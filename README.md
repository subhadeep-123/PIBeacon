### Bluetooth Low Energy  (BLE), in a containerized environment 

The `setup.sh` file automates the whole process of setting up the environment and executing to the shell, takes a few inputs in the process.

```./setup.sh```

Not that we are in the shell.

We need to configure the BLE from whithin the shell.

```./blesetup_docker.sh```

This will get the process of configuring the **hci0** and setting up the **UUID** done.
